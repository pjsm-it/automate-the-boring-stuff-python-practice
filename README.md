# Automate the Boring Stuff Python Practice

This repository contains Python scripts and exercises inspired by the book 
*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart. While the exercises 
provide the initial inspiration, all implementations are written by me and 
attempt to be distinct from the original examples to avoid copyright issues.

Some basic examples in this repository are taken directly from the book for 
learning purposes, but any modifications or extensions are my own work.

## Purpose

- Document my learning process and progress while studying Python.
- Practice automation techniques that can be applied to security operations.
- Keep a clear record of exercises and scripts for future reference.

## Usage

- All scripts are written in Python 3.
- You can run any script by executing `python3 script_name.py`.
- No sensitive data or real credentials are included.
